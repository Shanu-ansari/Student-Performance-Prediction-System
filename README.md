Student Performance Prediction
This project predicts student performance and potential dropout risk using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes demographic, social, and academic information from 649 students.

Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Applied Linear Regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Tree

Model evaluation using accuracy, RMSE, and confusion matrix

Identification of factors influencing academic success

Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Results:
The project compares models to determine the most accurate predictor of final student grades and risk of failure.
